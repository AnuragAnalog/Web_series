# Web Series

I have implemented a web application for viewing web series.

## Languages Used

* HTML

* CSS

* PHP

* JS

* MYSQL

> NOTE: I'am very poor at CSS

## Features

**Admin**

* Can add another admin

* Can add another user

* Can add videos details

* Can view who are the registered users and admins

**Everyone**

* Searchbar

* Multiple screens

## Changes to be made after cloning

This works on both lamp and xamp. If you are a linux user put this directory in
/var/www/html which is localhost.

Also change the username and password in *db_conn.php* file.
